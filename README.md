Fun in-progress python Discord bot that reports when someone says something the CCP may not like, or says something the CCP might like. Phrases can be easily edited. <br>

**IMPORTANT:** <br>
Remember to set the Permissions role correctly. <br>
You no longer need to set an admin role beforehand, anyone with admin permissions can do this automatically <br>
Also, do not forget to put your bot token in the last line of the code, put it inside the single quotes and remove the text already there.
